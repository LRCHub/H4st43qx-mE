[00:36.03] Lots of people watchin' things unravel, watch the moment, watch me go in
[01:12.03] 
[00:39.10] Locked and loaded, say some shit that'll make 'em think it, thought-provokin'

[00:45.76] Stay as busy as I want to, takin' trips to escape a bit
[00:48.97] Make it shift to a different gear, takin' things to a different tier
