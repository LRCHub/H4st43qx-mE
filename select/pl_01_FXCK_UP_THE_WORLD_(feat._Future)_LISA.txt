(ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
(Yeah)
Uh, uh,
woke up in that mode again
(Yeah)
Uh, uh,
please don't call my
phone again
(Yeah)
Uh, uh, walked in causing havoc
Yes, that is a habit
Bad, I'm bad, I'm tragic, yeah
They watch me on the stages
(Stages)
they watch me goin' crazy
(Crazy)
I'm 'bout to make 'em pick
the pieces up,
then lock 'em in the cages
(Cages)
A lot can happen in
a couple minutes,
lots of reasons,
lots of things in action
Lots of people watchin'
things unravel,
watch the moment,
watch me go in
Locked and loaded,
say some shit that'll
make 'em think it,
thought-provoking
Only do things that are
makin' history,
try to make moves
that'll make 'em miss me
Stay as busy as I want to,
takin' trips to escape a bit
Make it shift to
a different gear,
takin' things to
a different tier
Pop up with it on the roof
like a proper villain
All this spendin' got me
in a mood, driven by the vision
I've been livin',
sittin' pretty,
pretty 'fits and pretty cities
Busy, busy, uh,
really gettin' busy with it,
giddy up
(Yeah)
Uh, uh,
woke up in that mode again
(Yeah)
Uh, uh,
please don't call my
phone again
(Yeah)
Uh, uh, walked in causing havoc
Yes, that is a habit
Bad, I'm bad, I'm tragic, yeah,
yeah
Woke up feelin' like, like
Fuck up the world,
fuck up the world
I think I just might, might
Fuck up the world,
fuck up the world
Woke up feelin' like, like
Fuck up the world,
fuck up the world
I think I just might
I think—, I think— I just—,
I just—
(Pluto)
Woke up, splurgin' racks
(Woah)
I secured another bag
(For sure)
Skateboard LVP
(Hey)
Causin' havoc when I'm in
the streets
(Yeah)
Passport stamped, overseas
(Yeah)
Tycoon life of a G
All a shorty wanted was a Birkin
All this money comin',
you deserve it
Fresh, clean,
but I'm drinkin' dirty
Chopped the 'Rari,
chopped it to a 'vert
(Woo)
I secure the Lamb' chop first
Feel like I'm the greatest
show on Earth
Whipped the Phantom,
came back in a spurt
Patek water, ready on surf
This the type of mood I'm
in again
Diamonds on me, doin' it again
(Yeah)
Princess cuts lit up for the win
Poppin' out on one on one again
(Poppin' out)
High fashion, settin' trend
Ayy, say, ayy, say twin
(Ayy, say twin)
Lot of freestyles, no pen
Top dog, got to go big
(Yeah)
Uh, uh,
woke up in that mode again
(Yeah)
Uh, uh,
please don't call my
phone again
(Yeah)
Uh, uh, walked in causing havoc
Yes, that is a habit
Bad, I'm bad, I'm tragic, yeah,
yeah
Woke up feelin' like, like
Fuck up the world,
fuck up the world
I think I just might, might
Fuck up the world,
fuck up the world
Woke up feelin' like, like
Fuck up the world,
fuck up the world
I think I just might
I think—, I think— I just—,
I just—
Rappin' like my lease up,
I told them that I'm focused
(Yeah, yeah)
They want the old LISA,
then listen to my old shit
(Yeah, yeah)
Rappin' like a deep cut,
flowin' like the ocean
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
They want the old LISA,
then listen to my old shit
Woke up feelin' like, like
Fuck up the world,
fuck up the world
I think I just might, might
Fuck up the world,
fuck up the world
Woke up feelin' like, like
Fuck up the world,
fuck up the world
I think I just might
I think—, I think— I just—,
